🌌 Interstellar Interface

Interstellar Interface is an interactive web-based exploration platform developed during a NASA Hackathon. The application enables users to zoom seamlessly through layered, high-resolution space imagery, simulating an immersive deep-space navigation experience directly within the browser.

The goal of the project was to create a visually engaging and intuitive interface that allows users to explore astronomical imagery in a way that feels dynamic and exploratory rather than static. By implementing smooth zoom transitions and scalable image rendering, the platform gives users the sensation of traveling deeper into space with each interaction.

The project focused on:

Interactive UI/UX design to create a visually compelling and user-friendly exploration experience

Dynamic image scaling and smooth zoom transitions to simulate depth and spatial movement

Performance optimisation to ensure fluid interaction with high-resolution imagery

Responsive layout design for cross-device compatibility across desktop, tablet, and mobile

Collaborative development in a fast-paced hackathon environment, requiring rapid prototyping, effective teamwork, and efficient problem-solving

Beyond its visual appeal, the project demonstrates key front-end development skills including interactive event handling, layout structuring, and performance-conscious design. Built under tight time constraints, Interstellar Interface reflects both technical capability and the ability to work collaboratively under pressure.
